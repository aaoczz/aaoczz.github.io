      organization in the beautiful city of Los Angeles, using her phenomenological experiences<br>

      working with disadvantaged neighborhoods and communities, hoping to work towards racial equity in housing, promoting
      sustainable futures for large cities, advancing education equity, and overall collaborating with others to 
      combat public policy and social issues in SOCAL communities. Her interests include listening 
      to podcasts throughout her day, going to the gym, and spending time with her friends and family on 
      the weekends.ᯓ★ <br>
