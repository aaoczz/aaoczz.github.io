    <p>This project was assigned in one my sociology courses where we chose an
      existing social issue that we were passionate about and were asked to create a 
      psuedo newsletter in order to share the information we've gradually accumulated 
      throughout the class. In my project, I chose to write about the struggles and 
      under-representation for undocumented students and Latino communities. The purpose 
      of my newsletter was to bring awareness to the lack of resources and attention for 
      these students in order to reform the existing systems that marginalize and penalize 
      these students, and to begin thinking about what programs and services we could 
      implement in schools that can help these students succeed.</p>

    <p>In this project I conducted a psuedo research project where I interviewed my father
      to compare Latino immigrants'experience in navigating, raising and maintaining a 
      family in a foriegn country (and the implications it has on mental health and a 
      person's overall health). The purpose of this project was to understand the perceptions 
      immigrants hold about American society and to examine the transformation of the ideals 
      this group holds and how they're challenged. </p>

    <h1>⊱✿⊰Perfection as Expectation⊱✿⊰</h1>
    <h4>by Arely Ordonez-Chavez</h4>
    <img src="ss4.png" width="500" />
    <p>This piece is a multimedia representation of the pressure of attaining perfection and
      how that shapes and impacts indivduals on a personal level. This project was composed of
      on sentence prompts posted on hitRECord, which invited indivduals to create written or visual
      (such as drawings or pictures) submissions on how the stress of perfection looks like to
      them. The final product was collage of different submissions by random hitRECord contributors
      which encapsulated how perfection can negatively impact people through the, sometimes 
      unattainable, expectations to be perfect.
